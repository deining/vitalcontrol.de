{{< alert title="Attention" >}}
Entering the farm number is currently of interest for German farmers only. Farmers from all other nationalities currently do **not** benefit from entering the farm ID. This may change with future [firmware versions]({{< relref "../firmware/versions/" >}}) of VitalControl.

## Set your farm number

To set the company number on your device, proceed as follows:

1. Open the menu item <img src="/icons/gear.svg" width="25" align="bottom" alt="Settings" /> `Instellingen` in the main screen of your VitalControl device.

2. Invoke the submenu `Bedrijfsnummer`. An input mask appears in which you can conveniently set your farm number. First, use the arrow keys to navigate to the far left of the input field and select your country. Afterwards, use the arrow keys to enter your twelve-digit farm number.
