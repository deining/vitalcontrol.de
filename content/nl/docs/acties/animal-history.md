## Animal History

The animal history gives you an overview of the data recorded so far and the development of the selected animal. You are free to choose the information displayed. You can also choose whether the history should be displayed as a table or as a diagram. The animal history helps you to see if and when these animals were conspicuous the last time. It also helps to create transparency if several people carry out the animal inspection.

To view the animal history, proceed as follows:

1. In the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item &nbsp;<img src="/icons/actions.svg" width="40" align="bottom" alt="Actions" />  `Acties` and press the `OK` button.

2. Either scan an animal using the transponder or select an animal from the list. Confirm with `OK` and select an animal with the arrow keys △ ▽. Confirm with `OK`.

3. A submenu with the animal actions opens. Use the arrow keys ◁ ▷ △ ▽ to select the action <img src="/icons/actions/history.svg" width="23" align="bottom" alt="Animal history" /> `Dierhistorie` and confirm with `OK`.

4. The information that was set last is now displayed. Use the `F3` key &nbsp;<img src="/icons/footer/open-popup.svg" width="15" align="bottom" alt="Open popup" /> to open the selection menu for the information pages.

5. Use the arrow keys △ ▽ to select the desired information page. Confirm with the `F3` key or with the `OK` key.

6. The selected information page will be presented to you.

7. Use the middle `On/Off` button <img src="/icons/footer/on-off.svg" width="18" align="bottom" alt="On/Off button" />&nbsp; to switch between the list <img src="/icons/footer/list.svg" width="20" align="bottom" alt="Liste display" /> and graph <img src="/icons/footer/chart.svg" width="22" align="bottom" alt="Chart display" />&nbsp; display .
