## Massa opname

With the help of mass registration, you can capture a large number of animals in a short time and save them to your device. Use the barcode scanner to scan the barcodes for the ear tag number and date of birth on the cattle passports. The animal is saved automatically and you can scan the next passport straight away. To perform mass registration of animals, proceed as follows:

1. Connect the barcode scanner to the VitalControl using the cable.

2. On the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item <img src="/icons/main/new-animal.svg" width="35" align="bottom" alt="New animal" /> `Nieuw` and press the `OK` button.

3. A submenu opens. Use the arrow keys ◁ ▷ △ ▽ to select the menu item <img src="/icons/main/barcode-scan.svg" width="35" align="bottom" alt="Bulk recording" /> `Massa opname` and confirm with `OK`.

4. Another submenu opens, which contains one field for the animal' s ear tag number and another field for the animal's date of birth. First scan the barcode for the ear tag number. The border of the field changes from red to green. Then scan the date of birth. The border briefly turns green before both borders appear red again. The counter beneath the passport symbol <img src="/icons/header/animal-passports.svg" width="25" align="bottom" alt="Animal passports" title="Animal passports" /> at the top of the screen is increased from 0 to 1. The first animal has been saved. Continue and scan the other cattle passports. After each passport scanned, the counter beneath on the passport symbol <img src="/icons/header/animal-passports.svg" width="25" align="bottom" alt="Animal passports" title="Animal passports" /> increases by one. The counter beneath the herd symbol <img src="/icons/header/group.svg" width="35" align="bottom" alt="Animal group"  title="Animal group" /> also increases by one. 

{{% alert title="Hint" %}}
The counter beneath the passport symbol <img src="/icons/header/animal-passports.svg" width="25" align="bottom" alt="Animal passports" title="Animal passports" /> shows how many passes you have scanned in one go without leaving the `Massa opname` screen. The counter beneath the herd symbol <img src="/icons/header/group.svg" width="35" align="bottom" alt="New animal" /> shows how many passports you have scanned in total. This counter does not reset to zero if you leave the `Massa opname` screen. The number is equivalent to your entries in the menu item ['Purchases'](../new-on-farm/purchased-animals/).

### Geboorte datum moet aangegeven worden

With this setting option you can determine whether the date of birth must be specified when creating the animals. If you deactivate this option, you only have to scan the barcode to save an animal.

1. Use the <img src="/icons/gear.svg" width="25" align="bottom" alt="Settings menu" /> `On/Off` button to open the settings menu.

2. Use the arrow keys △ ▽ to select the setting option `Geboorte datum moet aangegeven worden` and confirm with `OK`.

3. The yellow circle symbolizes that the function is activated. A gray circle symbolizes that the function is deactivated.

4. Save the settings and use the `F1` key &nbsp;<img src="/icons/footer/save_exit.svg" width="65" align="bottom" alt="Save and return" /> to return to the menu item <img src="/icons/main/barcode-scan.svg" width="35" align="bottom" alt="Bulk recording" />&nbsp; `Massa opname`.
