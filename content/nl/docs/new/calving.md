## Register a kalving

To register a calving, proceed as follows:

1. In the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item <img src="/icons/main/new-animal.svg" width="35" align="bottom" alt="New animal" /> `Nieuw` and press the `OK` button.

2. A submenu opens. Use the arrow keys ◁ ▷ △ ▽ to select the menu item <img src="/icons/actions/calving.svg" width="25" align="bottom" alt="Calving" /> `Kalving` and confirm with `OK`.

3. Give the ID of the dam, either via scan of the dam's transponder or by pressing the `OK` button and entering the ID of the dam using the arrow keys ◁ ▷ △ ▽ and confirming with `OK`. Now either scan the transponder of the newborn calf or use the `F3` key `ESC` to continue without scanning. Use this function if the calf does not yet have a transponder. You can scan a transponder later on once it was attached to the animal.

4. Another submenu opens in which you can save information about the calf. Use the arrow keys △ ▽ to select the desired setting item.

5. For the settings `Type van nutdier`,`Geslacht` ,`Geboortegewicht`, `Ras`, `verblijfplaats`, `Eenling/Meerling` and `Afkalfverloop`, use the arrow keys ◁ ▷ to select the desired setting.

6. For the settings `Oormerknummer`, `ID` and `Geboortedatum` use the arrow keys △ ▽ to select the desired setting option and confirm with `OK`. Use the arrow keys △ ▽◁ ▷ to select the desired numbers. Finally, confirm with `OK`.
