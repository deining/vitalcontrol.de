In this evaluation you can view your loss rates as a history. The loss rate is given to you as a percentage and divided into the categories green, yellow and red. The stored percentages are factory set, the green area is between 0 and 4 %, the yellow area is between 4 and 8 %, the red area represents a mortality rate above 8 %.
To perform the evaluation, proceed as follows:

1. In the main screen of your device highlight the icon &nbsp;<img src="/icons/main/evaluation.svg" width="50" align="bottom" alt="Evaluate" />&nbsp; `Evaluatie`. Confirm with `OK`.

2. Another submenu opens in which you can use the arrow keys △ ▽ ◁ ▷ to choose between the menu items `Gewicht`, `Temperatuur`, `Beoordeling` and `Sterfte`. Select &nbsp;<img src="/icons/evaluation/calflosses.svg" width="60" align="bottom" alt="Mortality" />&nbsp; `Sterfte` and confirm with `OK`.

3. The device now starts to calculate the success variables.
