2. A submenu opens. Use the arrow buttons △ ▽ to navigate to the `data management` item and confirm with `OK`.

3. Another submenu opens. Use the arrow buttons △ ▽ to navigate to the `animal data` item and confirm with `OK`. 

4. Another submenu opens. Use the arrow buttons △ ▽ to navigate to the item `unregister animals: `.

5. Use the arrow buttons ◁ ▷ to select whether you want to deregister the animals `older than 100 days` or `no transponder assigned`. The "Count" item shows you how many animals will be deregistered. Confirm your selection with `OK`.

6. Confirm the security pop-up with the `F3` button.
