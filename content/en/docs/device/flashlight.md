## Activate and deactivate light {#activate-and-deactivate-light}

Here you can activate or deactivate the light on your VitalControl device. If you activate the light, it lights up permanently.

1. On the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item <img src="/icons/device.svg" width="25" align="bottom" alt="Device" /> `{{<T "Device" >}}` and press the `{{<T "Ok" >}}` button.

2. A submenu opens with several menu items. Select `{{<T "Flashlight" >}}` and confirm with `{{<T "Ok" >}}` or use the `F3` (On) key.

3. The light is now activated. This setting is symbolized by a yellow circle. Confirm again with `{{<T "Ok" >}}` or use the `F3` (Off) key to deactivate the light.
