## Test temperature measurement {#test-temperature-measurement}

Here you can test the temperature measurement of your device without saving the measurement for an animal. To carry out the test, proceed as follows:

1. On the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item <img src="/icons/device.svg" width="25" align="bottom" alt="Device" /> `{{<T "Device" >}}` and press the `{{<T "Ok" >}}` button.

2. A submenu opens with several menu items. Select `{{<T "MeasurementsTemperature" >}}` and confirm with `{{<T "Ok" >}}`.

3. Now carry out the measurement.
