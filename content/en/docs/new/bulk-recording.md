## Bulk-recording

With the help of mass access, you can capture a large number of animals in a short time and save them to your device. Use the barcode scanner to scan the barcodes for the ear tag number and date of birth on the cattle passports. The animal is saved automatically and you can scan the next passport straight away. To use mass access, proceed as follows:

1. Connect the barcode scanner to the VitalControl using the cable.

2. On the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item `New` and press the `OK` button.

3. A submenu opens. Use the arrow keys ◁ ▷ △ ▽ to select the menu item `Bulk-recording` and confirm with `OK`. 

4. Another submenu opens, which contains a field for the ear tag number and a field for the date of birth. First scan the barcode for the ear tag number. The border of the field changes from red to green. Then scan the date of birth. The border briefly turns green before both borders appear red again. The number on the scanner icon at the top of the screen changes from 0 to 1. The first animal has been saved. Continue and scan the other cattle passes. After each passport is scanned, the number on the scanner symbol increases by one.

### Birth date mandatory

With this setting option you can determine whether the date of birth must be specified when creating the animals. If you deactivate this option, you only have to scan the barcode to save an animal. For these animals, however, the current date is then stored as the date of birth! This feature is enabled by default. To deactivate it, do the following:

1. Use the `On/Off` button to open the settings menu.

2. Use the arrow keys △ ▽ to select the setting option `birth date mandatory` and confirm with `OK`.

3. The yellow circle symbolizes that the function is activated. A gray circle symbolizes that the function is deactivated.

4. Save the settings and use the `F1` key to return to the `bulk-recording` menu item.
