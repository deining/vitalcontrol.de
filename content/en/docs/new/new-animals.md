## Create several new animals

In this menu item you can register several new animals at once. In doing so, you set a basic setting that applies to all animals during this creation.

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
You can use this function if you want to register animals with a consecutive transponder and a consecutive ear tag number. Use the animal with the highest or lowest transponder and ear tag number to scan. Depending on your settings, VitalControl then continuously counts up or down the transponder and ear tag numbers of the next animals to be created.

To create several new animals, proceed as follows:

1. In the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item <img src="/icons/new-animal.svg" width="35" align="bottom" alt="New animal" /> `New` and press the `OK` button.

2. A submenu opens. Use the arrow keys ◁ ▷ △ ▽ to select the menu item <img src="/icons/neueTiere.svg" width="35" align="bottom" alt="New animals" /> `New animals` and confirm with `OK`.

3. Either scan the animal's transponder or use the `F3` ESC key to continue without a scanned transponder. You can use this function if the animal does not yet have a transponder. You can scan this later and assign it to the animal.

4. Another submenu opens in which you can save the information about the animals. Use the arrow keys △ ▽ to select the desired setting item.

5. For the settings `tye of animal`,`Sex` ,`Birth weight`, `Breed`, `Whereabouts` and `Number to be created` use the arrow keys ◁ ▷ to select the desired setting. With the `Number to be created` you determine how many new animals you want to create at once.

6. For the settings `national animal ID`and `ID of first animal` use the arrow keys △ ▽ to select the desired setting option and confirm with `OK`. Use the arrow keys △ ▽◁ ▷ to select the desired numbers. Finally, confirm with `OK`.

7. Save the settings and create the new animal with the `F3` key &nbsp;<img src="/icons/footer/save_exit.svg" width="65" align="bottom" alt="Save and return" />&nbsp;.
