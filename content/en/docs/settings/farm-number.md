{{< alert title="Attention" >}}
Entering the farm number is currently of interest for German farmers only. Farmers from all other nationalities currently do **not** benefit from entering the farm ID. This may change with future [firmware versions]({{< relref "../firmware/versions/" >}}) of VitalControl.
