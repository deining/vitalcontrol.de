### Birth weight {#birth-weight}

The device uses the birth weight stored here in the settings as the default value when creating new animals. In order to be able to select the individual birth weight of a newly born animal more quickly, you may need to adjust this default value for your farm. To adjust the value for the `{{<T "BirthWeight" >}}`, proceed as follows:

1. In the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item <img src="/icons/gear.svg" width="25" align="bottom" alt="Settings" /> `{{<T "Settings" >}}` and press the `{{<T "Ok" >}}` button.

2. A submenu opens in which various settings are displayed. Use the arrow keys ‚ñ≥ ‚ñΩ to select `{{<T "DataAcquisition" >}}`. Confirm with `{{<T "Ok" >}}`.

3. Another submenu opens in which you can use the arrow keys ‚ñ≥ ‚ñΩ to switch between the setting fields for `{{<T "WeightRecording" >}}`, `{{<T "RatingAnimals" >}}` and `{{<T "ControlPeriodFreshCows" >}}`. Select `{{<T "WeightRecording" >}}`and confirm with `{{<T "Ok" >}}`.

4. Use the arrow keys ‚ñ≥ ‚ñΩ to select the setting field `{{<T "BirthWeight" >}}` and use the arrow keys ‚óÅ ‚ñ∑ to set the desired birth weight. The device now uses the birth weight defined here as the standard when creating new animals. The individual birth weight of a newborn animal can then be selected more quickly.

    ![VitalControl: menu settings birth weight](../images/birthweight.png "Birth weight")

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
The standard birth weight is only an approximate value, which must be individually adjusted when creating a new animal.
If you do not want to make this adjustment or if you create animals automatically [in the background](../animal-registration/#auto-registration), no birth weight should be queried or saved when creating a new animal. birth weight should not be queried or saved when creating a new animal. This can be defined in the settings for [registration of animals](../animal-registration/#set-recorded-weights).
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="Default values birth weights:" %}}

| Kind of new animal            |  Lamb          | Calf          |
|-------------------------------|----------------|---------------| 
| Default value *birth weight*: | 4 kg           | 40 kg         |
| Value range :                 | 1,0 bis 99 kg  | 1,0 bis 99 kg |
{{% /alert %}}

### Average daily weight gain {#average-daily-weight-gain}

{{% alert title="Explanation" %}}
When [weighing](../../actions/record-weight/) an animal, the defined daily increase is used for the calculation of the suggested weight value during animal weighing. If the suggested weight value is too low or too high for the majority of the animals to be weighed, you should adjust the defined value downwards or upwards, respectively, to shorten the time needed for adjusting the weight value with the arrow keys.
{{% /alert %}}

To set the `{{<T "AverageDailyWeightGain" >}}` used in the calculation of the approximate weight of an animal proceed as follows.

1. In the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item <img src="/icons/gear.svg" width="25" align="bottom" alt="Settings" /> `{{<T "Settings" >}}` and press the `{{<T "Ok" >}}` button.

2. A submenu opens in which various settings are displayed. Use the arrow keys ‚ñ≥ ‚ñΩ to select `{{<T "DataAcquisition" >}}`. Confirm with `{{<T "Ok" >}}`.

3. Another submenu opens in which you can use the arrow keys ‚ñ≥ ‚ñΩ to switch between the setting fields for `{{<T "WeightRecording" >}}`, `{{<T "RatingAnimals" >}}` and `{{<T "ControlPeriodFreshCows" >}}`. Select `{{<T "WeightRecording" >}}`and confirm with `{{<T "Ok" >}}`.

4. Use the arrow keys ‚ñ≥ ‚ñΩ to select the setting field `{{<T "AverageDailyWeightGain" >}}`. Use the arrow keys ‚óÅ ‚ñ∑ to set the desired average daily increase g/day. The device now uses the average daily gain defined here as the standard for the expected daily gain of the animals.

### Precision of weight recording {#precision-of-weight-recording}

{{% alert title="Explanation" %}}
Depending on the use case and animal species (*lamb*, *calf*, *cow*), there are different requirements regarding the resolution of the weight value to be recorded (accuracy of *10 g*, *100 g* or *1 kg*). To meet these requirements one is required to make use of the *Maximum accuracy* setting.
{{% /alert %}}

The table below shows the precision of weight recording depending on the weight range and the setting stipulated for *Maximum accuracy*:

| Setting *Maximum precision*:               |  10 g | 100 g | 1 kg |
|--------------------------------------------|-------|-------|------|
| Precision in the range of *0 to 9,9 kg*:   | 10 g  | 100 g | 1 kg |
| Precision in the range of *10 to 49,9 kg*: | 100 g | 100 g | 1 kg |
| Precision in the range of *50 to 99,9 kg*: | 500 g | 500 g | 1 kg |
| Precision for values *‚â• 100 kg*:           | 1 kg  | 1 kg  | 1 kg |

To set the maximum accuracy when recording animal weights with your device, proceed as follows:

1. In the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item <img src="/icons/gear.svg" width="25" align="bottom" alt="Settings" /> `{{<T "Settings" >}}` and press the `{{<T "Ok" >}}` button..

2. A submenu opens in which various settings are displayed. Use the arrow keys ‚ñ≥ ‚ñΩ to select `{{<T "DataAcquisition" >}}`. Confirm with `{{<T "Ok" >}}`.

3. Another submenu opens in which you can use the arrow keys ‚ñ≥ ‚ñΩ to switch between the setting fields for `{{<T "WeightRecording" >}}`, `{{<T "RatingAnimals" >}}` and `{{<T "ControlPeriodFreshCows" >}}`. Select `{{<T "WeightRecording" >}}`and confirm with `{{<T "Ok" >}}`.

4. Use the arrow keys ‚ñ≥ ‚ñΩ to select the setting field `{{<T "MaximumPrecision" >}}`. Use the arrow keys ‚óÅ ‚ñ∑ to set the desired maximum precision. Precision of weight recording on the device now follows the stipulated setting.

## Control period of fresh cows {#control-period-of-fresh-cows}

{{% alert title="Explanation" %}}
When managing fresh cows, checking the animals daily for several days after birth, including taking their temperature is considered a best practices routine. The duration of this control period varies considerably from farm to farm. For this reason, the length of the control period can be set to a value between 3 and 14 days in the VitalControl settings. The set value for the control period of fresh cows determines the number of columns of the column chart displayed for each animal in the [fresh cow list](../../lists/fresh-cows/).
{{% /alert %}}

To set the length of the Control period for your fresh cows proceed as follows:

1. In the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item <img src="/icons/gear.svg" width="25" align="bottom" alt="Settings" /> `{{<T "Settings" >}}` and press the `{{<T "Ok" >}}` button.

2. A submenu opens in which various settings are displayed. Use the arrow keys ‚ñ≥ ‚ñΩ to select `{{<T "DataAcquisition" >}}`. Confirm with `{{<T "Ok" >}}`.

3.  Another submenu opens in which you can use the arrow keys ‚ñ≥ ‚ñΩ to switch between the setting fields for `{{<T "WeightRecording" >}}`, `{{<T "RatingAnimals" >}}` and `{{<T "ControlPeriodFreshCows" >}}`. Select `{{<T "ControlPeriodFreshCows" >}}`and confirm with `{{<T "Ok" >}}`.

4. Use the ‚óÅ ‚ñ∑ arrow keys to set the desired duration of the control period in days post partum.
