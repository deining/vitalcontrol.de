### Set birth weight

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
The standard birth weight is only an approximate value, 
which must be individually adjusted when creating a new animal. 
If you do not want to make this adjustment or if you create animals automatically in the background, no birth weight should be requested or saved when creating a new animal. birth weight should not be queried or saved when creating a new animal. This can be arranged in the settings for "Registration of animals".
