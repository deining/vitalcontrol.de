## Set the threshold & temperature ranges {#set-the-threshold--temperature-ranges}
{{% alert title = "Hint" %}}
Threshold values for the body temperature are stored here individually for the animal species calf, cow and lamb. The yellow and red fields show the threshold value for "elevated temperature" and "fever" respectively. VitalControl places animals in the yellow and red areas on the alarm list, making it easier for you to monitor sick animals. A threshold for under temperature can also be freely defined.
{{% /alert %}}

To set the threshold & temperature ranges on your device proceed as follows:

1. From the main screen of your VitalControl device, select <img src="/icons/gear.svg" width="25" align="bottom" alt="Settings" /> `Settings` and press the `OK` button.

2. A submenu opens in which various settings are displayed. Use the arrow keys ‚ñ≥ ‚ñΩ to select `Temperature`. Confirm with `OK`.

3. Another submenu opens in which you can use the arrow keys ‚ñ≥ ‚ñΩ to switch between the two setting fields for `Thresholds`, `Undertemperature` and `Anus spotlight`. Select the `Threshold` settings field.

4. Use the arrow keys ‚óÅ ‚ñ∑ to select the desired threshold.

5. Use the pen symbol with the <img src="/icons/actions/edit.svg" width="24" align="bottom" alt="Bearbeiten" /> `F3`key to set the threshold value of the yellow and red area. Use the arrows ‚ñ≥ ‚ñΩ to set the desired "greater than" or "equal to" temperature. Use the keys `F2`/`F3` ü°Ñ ü°Ü or the ‚óÅ ‚ñ∑ arrow keys to select between the yellow and red ranges.

6. Once you have set the desired "greater than" or "equal to" temperature, use the back arrow with the `F1` key to jump back to the `Threshold` value.
