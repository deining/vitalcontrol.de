## Unlink Transponder

You can use this setting to specify how the animal ID should be assigned as soon as you remove the transponder from the animal. This setting can be used if, for example, the synchronization with the UrbanAlmaPro has been carried out and the animal IDs on the VitalControl now correspond to the collar number of the animals. As soon as you remove the collar and detach the transponder, you can specify that the animal ID is now derived from the ear tag number. This allows you to quickly identify the animal in the barn without a collar.

1. Open the <img src="/icons/gear.svg" width="25" align="bottom" alt="Settings" /> `Settings` menu on the main screen of your VitalControl device.

2. A submenu opens in which various settings are displayed. Use the arrow buttons △ ▽ to select `unlink transponder`. Confirm with `OK`.

3. Now use the arrow buttons ◁ ▷ to select your desired setting. You can choose between `no change` or `derivation from eartag number`.

4. The setting option `derivation from eartag number` allows you to make further settings. See [here](/en/docs/settings/animal-registration/#digit-of-the-new-id).
