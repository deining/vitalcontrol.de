{{% alert title = "Hint" %}}
When the user confirms the creation of animals, an input screen appears in which the user can enter the data of the new animal to be created (gender, date of birth, etc.). With automatic creation, the values ​​defined in "Settings > Create new animals" are used for all automatically created animals for sex, age, etc. Animal-specific settings are not possible here.
{{% /alert %}}

In order to define the behavior when the user animal is automatically created on your device, proceed as follows:

## Assignment animal ID {#assignment-animal-id}

Here you define which animal ID is proposed (derived from transponder number) or used (consecutive) when creating a new animal in your farm.

{{% alert title = "Hint" %}}
Select the "Consecutive" option if the stall number you use for visual identification of the animal is assigned independently of the transponder number used for electronic identification. The stall or collar numbers are then assigned consecutively within a certain range (e.g. 1 - 40) and are then not directly related to the transponder numbers used. Select the option "Derive from transponder number" if you want to link the animal's stall number directly to the number of the transponder that was assigned to the animal. This option is especially useful if you use yellow electronic ear tags, the barn number is then identical to the end digits of the ten-digit animal number printed on the yellow ear tag.
{{% /alert %}}

To define the assignment of the animal ID when creating the farm animal on your device, proceed as follows:

1. In the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item <img src="/icons/gear.svg" width="25" align="bottom" alt="Settings" /> `Settings` and press the `OK` key.

2. A submenu opens in which various settings are displayed. Use the arrow keys △ ▽ to select `Registration of animals`. Confirm with `OK`.

3. Another submenu opens in which you can use the arrow keys △ ▽ to switch between the setting fields for `Default values`, `Auto-registration` and `Assignment ear tag number`. Select `Auto-registration` and confirm with `OK`.

5. Use the arrow keys ◁ ▷ to set the assignment of the animal ID of the working animal when creating.

6. If you select the setting `Consecutive`, you have the option of specifying the `Next animal ID`. Use the arrow keys △ ▽ to select the `Next animal ID` area and confirm with `OK`. Navigate within the area using the arrow keys ◁ ▷. Now you can select a number using the arrow keys △ ▽. The device will now automatically use this number to start the continuous count from there. Furthermore, you can set whether the numbers are to be counted continuously increasing or continuously decreasing. To do this, use the arrow keys ◁ ▷ to go to the 9/1 symbol. Use the arrow keys △ ▽ to toggle between counting continuously increasing or continuously decreasing. Save the settings using the `F1` or `OK` key &nbsp;<img src="/icons/footer/save_exit.svg" width="65" align="bottom" alt="Save and return" />&nbsp;.

    ![VitalControl: menu settings assignment animal ID](../images/assignmentanimalid2.png "Assignment animal ID")

    ![VitalControl: menu settings assignment animal ID](../images/assignmentanimalid3.png "assignment animal ID")

{{% alert title = "Hint" %}}
Only when using the option `Consecutive`: if you have set to use separate number ranges for male and female animals when assigning the ear tag number, a next animal number is stored for each of male, female and animals of unknown sex. A symbol placed to the left of the animal number indicates what the next animal number is used for: either for male ♀ or for female ♂ or for animals of unknown sex ♀♂?

### Digit of the new ID {#digit-of-the-new-id}

### Right offset {#right-offset}

Here you define whether an offset is also taken into account when deriving a barn number from the transponder number. Without offset the last 2-6 digits of the transponder number will be used as stable number, with an offset of 1 the rightmost digit will be discarded, with an offset of 2 the two rightmost digits, and so on.

{{% alert title = "Hint" %}}
To graphically illustrate the effect of the set parameters, a fifteen-digit transponder number is displayed below the line for setting the offset. A green frame indicates the stall number that would be derived from the transponder number with the current settings. A change of the setting values "Length" and "Offset" leads directly to an update of the derived
leads immediately to an update of the derived barn number.
