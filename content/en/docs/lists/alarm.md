## Alarm list

On the alarm list you will find all animals that you have either manually added to the list or all animals that were in the yellow or red range when the temperature was measured. The list helps you to keep an overview of all conspicuous animals. Also, for each animal on the list, you can do the following:

- [Full action menu](#full-action-menu)
- [Animal data](#animal-data)
- [Take temperature](#take-temperature)
- [Rate animal](#rate-animal)
- [Clear alarm](#clear-alarm)
- [Toggle watch status](#toggle-watch-status)
- [Search animal](#search-animal)
- [Set filter](#set-filter)

The alarm list is structured as follows:

   ![VitalControl Lists Alarm list](../images/alarmstructure.png "Structure of the alarm list")
