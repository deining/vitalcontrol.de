## Dry cows list

On the list of dry animals you will find all animals that you have saved as dry animals. This list will help you keep track of your dry cows and carry out necessary actions on the animals. You can perform the following actions:

- [Full action menu](../alarm/#full-action-menu)
- [Animal data](../alarm/#animal-data)
- [Take temperature](../alarm/#take-temperature)
- [Calving](#calving)
- [Toggle alarm status](../on-watch/#toggle-alarm-status)
- [Toggle watch status](../alarm/#toggle-watch-status)
- [Search animal](../alarm/#search-animal)
- [Set filter](../alarm/#set-filter)

{{% alert title="Hint" %}}
Some actions are to be carried out in the same way as in the [Alarm list](../alarm). These are not explained here. Carry out the preliminary steps and use the link of the respective action to get to the instructions.

## Calving

1. Complete the preliminary steps.

2. Use the `F3` key to open the possible actions. Use the arrow keys △ ▽ to select the action `calving` and confirm with the `F3` key or with `OK`.

3. Within the actionlist, use the arrow keys △ ▽ to select the desired animal and confirm with `OK`.

4. You will now be asked to scan the mother animal's transponder. Alternatively, you can also confirm with `OK` and enter the animal ID with the arrow keys △ ▽ ◁ ▷.

5. Now scan the calf's transponder or skip this step with the 'F3' ESC key if the calf does not yet have a transponder. You can later assign this to the animal using the `transponder number` function.

6. Another settings menu opens in which you can save various details about the new calf. Use the arrow keys △ ▽ to select the appropriate setting option. For the setting options `Type of animal`, `Sex`, `Birth weight`, `Breed`, `Whereabouts`, `Multiples` and `Calving ease` use the arrow keys △ ▽ to select the desired setting. For the setting options `National animal ID`, `ID` and `Date of birth` select the corresponding setting option and confirm with `OK`. Now use the arrow keys △ ▽ ◁ ▷ to select the desired numbers.

7. Save the settings with the `F3` key.
