## On watch list

On the watch list you will find all animals that you have manually added to the list. The list helps you to keep an overview of the animals you have rated as conspicuous. Also, for each animal on the list, you can do the following:

- [Full action menu](../alarm/#full-action-menu)
- [Animal data](../alarm/#animal-data)
- [Take temperature](../alarm/#take-temperature)
- [Rate animal](../alarm/#rate-animal)
- [Remove from watch list](#remove-from-watch-list)
- [Toggle alarm status](#toggle-alarm-status)
- [Search animal](../alarm/#search-animal)
- [Set filter](../alarm/#set-filter)

{{% alert title="Hint" %}}
Some actions are to be carried out in the same way as in the [Alarm list](../alarm). These are not explained here. Carry out the preliminary steps and use the link of the respective action to get to the instructions.
{{% /alert %}}

The alarm list is structured as follows:
