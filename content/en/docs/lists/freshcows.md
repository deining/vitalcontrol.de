### Fresh cows list

{{% alert title="Explanation" %}}
When managing fresh cows, checking the animals daily for several days after birth is considered a best practices routine. The fresh cows list supports facilitates ths fresh cow control, especially in terms of temperature recording. For each animal, a column chart over all days of the control period is shown, each day of the control period is represented by a vertical bar. Depending on the colour of the bar (green, yellow or red), you can see whether a normal, elevated or critically elevated temperature was measured on that day for the respective animal.

Cows are put on the fresh cows list immediately after their calving has been registered. They remain on that list for a certain period of time, the length of this period (in days) can be adjusted in the [settings](../../settings/data-acquisition/#control-period-of-fresh-cows).
 The following actions are available for this list:

- [Full action menu](../alarm/#full-action-menu)
- [Animal data](../alarm/#animal-data)
- [Take temperature](../alarm/#take-temperature)
- [Toggle alarm status](#toggle-alarm-status)
- [Toggle watch status](#toggle-watch-status)
- [Hide measured cows](#hide-measured-cows)
- [Search animal](../alarm/#search-animal)
- [Set filter](../alarm/#set-filter)

{{% alert title="Hint" %}}
