If there is a malfunction on your device, you should first perform a hardware check to clarify whether any of the hardware components is defective.

## Check the hardware of your device

1. Open the menu item &nbsp;<img src="/icons/device.svg" width="23" align="bottom" alt="Device" /> `Device` in the main screen of your VitalControl device.

1. Invoke the submenu `Service`, select the menu item `Check device drivers` and confirm with `OK`.

The device now lists all hardware components of the device, together with their status. Ideally, all components listed should show a green dot on the far right; this signals a functioning component. If a red dot is shown for a component, this indicates that the corresponding component is defective. In this case, the device must be returned to the manufacturer for service.

If the status of all components is shown as as intact (green dots) and there is still a malfunction of the device, it may be a software defect. In this case, contact your local dealer or the manufacturer's [service hotline](https://www.urbanonline.de/en/contact).
