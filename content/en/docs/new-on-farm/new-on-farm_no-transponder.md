### New on farm, no transponder

In this list you will find all newly created animals with a maximum age of X days that have not yet been assigned a transponder. You can set the maximum age [here](/en/docs/settings/animal-registration/#set-default-values). Once you have collected a transponder from these animals, you can search for the corresponding animal ID within the list and scan the associated transponder. The transponder is then automatically assigned to the animal and the animal is deleted from the list. To assign a transponder, proceed as follows:

1. In the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item <img src="/icons/main/new-on-farm.svg" width="40" align="bottom" alt="New on farm" /> `New on farm` and press the `OK` button.

2.  A submenu opens in which you can choose between <img src="/icons/keintransponder.svg" width="40" align="bottom" alt="New on farm, no transponder" /> `New on farm, no transponder`, <img src="/icons/main/new-on-farm.svg" width="40" align="bottom" alt="Purchased animals" /> `Purchased animals`, <img src="/icons/keineOhrmarke.svg" width="40" align="bottom" alt="No national animal ID" /> `No national animal ID assigned`, <img src="/icons/main/births.svg" width="40" align="bottom" alt="Births" /> `Births` and <img src="/icons/keinTransponder.svg" width="40" align="bottom" alt="No transponder assigned" /> `No transponder assigned`. Use the arrow keys ◁ ▷ △ ▽ to select the menu item <img src="/icons/keintransponder.svg" width="40" align="bottom" alt="New on farm, no transponder" /> `New on farm, no transponder` and confirm with 'OK'.

3. A list opens with all animals that have been newly created but to which no transponder has yet been assigned. Use the arrow keys △ ▽ to select the desired animal and confirm with `OK`. Alternatively, you can search for an animal. Use the `On/Off` button <img src="/icons/footer/search.svg" width="15" align="bottom" alt="Search" /> and use the arrow keys ◁ ▷ △ ▽ to select the desired digits. Finally confirm with `OK`.

4. Now scan the animal's transponder.

5. A transponder has been successfully added to the animal.
