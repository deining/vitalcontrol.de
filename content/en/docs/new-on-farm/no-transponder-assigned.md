## No transponder assigned

The handling within this list is identical to the `New on farm, no transponder` list. However, in this list you will find all animals that have not yet been assigned a transponder, regardless of their age.

1. In the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item <img src="/icons/main/new-on-farm.svg" width="40" align="bottom" alt="New on farm" /> `New on farm` and press the `OK` button.

2. A submenu opens in which you can choose between <img src="/icons/registration/new-on-farm-no-transponder.svg" width="50" align="bottom" alt="New on farm, no transponder" /> `New on farm, no transponder`, <img src="/icons/main/new-on-farm.svg" width="40" align="bottom" alt="Purchased animals" /> `Purchased animals`, <img src="/icons/registration/no-eartag-number.svg" width="30" align="bottom" alt="No national animal ID" /> `No national animal ID assigned`, <img src="/icons/main/births.svg" width="40" align="bottom" alt="Births" /> `Births` and <img src="/icons/registration/no-transponder.svg" width="30" align="bottom" alt="No transponder assigned" /> `No transponder assigned`. Use the arrow keys ◁ ▷ △ ▽ to select the menu item <img src="/icons/registration/no-transponder.svg" width="30" align="bottom" alt="No transponder assigned" /> `No transponder assigned` and confirm with `OK`.

3. A list opens with all animals that have not yet been assigned a transponder. To assign a transponder, proceed as in [`New on farm, no transponder`](../new-no-transponder/#new-on-farm-no-transponder) from step three.
