## Purchased animals

In this list you will find all the animals that you have created via bulk recording. You can export this list and thus register your additions directly in the herd management program DSP-Herde and in HI-Tier. Alternatively, you can delete all purchase notices.

To export data you need the included UBS stick. Connect the USB stick with the USB-C adapter to your VitalControl device before following the instructions.
