## Rate your animals

When rating the animal, you document the condition of the individual animal. The condition is determined visually and recorded with the help of the traffic light system. In the basic assessment, only the general condition is recorded. In the extended evaluation you record the general condition, feed intake, consistency of faeces  and respiratory diseases. You can either change the rating mode directly in the <img src="/icons/actions/rating.svg" width="30" align="bottom" alt="Rating" /> `Rating` action or you can define it in the [settings](../../settings/data-acquisition/#mode-of-animal-rating).

A yellow or red evaluation means that VitalControl classifies the animal as conspicuous and puts it on the alarm list.

1. In the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item &nbsp;<img src="/icons/actions.svg" width="40" align="bottom" alt="Actions" /> `Actions` and press the `OK` button.

2. Either scan an animal using the transponder or select an animal from the list. Confirm with `OK` and select an animal with the arrow keys △ ▽. Confirm with `OK`.

3. A submenu with the animal actions opens. Use the arrow keys ◁ ▷ to select the action <img src="/icons/actions/rating.svg" width="30" align="bottom" alt="Rating" /> `Rating` and confirm with `OK`.

4. The rating menu opens. If you want to switch the rating mode, use the `On/Off` &nbsp;<img src="/icons/gear.svg" width="25" align="bottom" alt="Chain-of-actions" />&nbsp; button and the arrow keys ◁ ▷. With the `F1` key <img src="/icons/footer/exit.svg" width="24" align="bottom" alt="Back" />&nbsp; you get back to the evaluation menu.

5. Use the arrow keys ◁ ▷ △ ▽ to select a state and save it with the `F3` key <img src="/icons/footer/save.svg" width="25" align="bottom" alt="Save" /> or the `OK` key.

6. In advanced mode, use the `F1` and `F3` keys to switch between the rating parameters.

{{% alert title="Hint" %}}
If you do not make a selection using the arrow keys ◁ ▷ but save directly using the `F3` or `OK` key, VitalControl saves a neutral assessment, represented by a gray color.

If this action is not available, the action has probably been deactivated! Activate the action in the [action settings](../settings/) menu. Alternatively, resetting all actions will bring that action back up.
