## Rate your animals

When rating the animal, you document the condition of the individual animal. The condition is determined visually and recorded with the help of the traffic light system. In the basic assessment, only the general condition is recorded. In the extended evaluation you record the general condition, feed intake, consistency of faeces  and respiratory diseases. You can either change the rating mode directly in the `Rating` action or you can define it in the [Settings](..).

A yellow or red evaluation means that VitalControl classifies the animal as conspicuous and puts it on the alarm list.
