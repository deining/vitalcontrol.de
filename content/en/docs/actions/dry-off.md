## Dry off

{{% alert title="Hint" %}}
Depending on the initial status of the cow, you can either dry the animal and add it to the dryer list, or you can mark the animal as a fresh milker and thus add it to the fresh milker list. The distinction between the functions is made clear by a plus symbol or a minus symbol.
