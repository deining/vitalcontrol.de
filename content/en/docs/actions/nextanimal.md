## Next animal

Within the `actions` menu you have the option of selecting the next animal at any time without having to leave the Actions menu item. To select the next animal, do the following:

1. On the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item `actions` and press the `OK` button.

2. Either scan an animal using the transponder or select an animal from the list. To do this, confirm with `OK` and select an animal using the arrow keys △ ▽. Confirm with `OK`.

3. A submenu with the animal actions opens. In the lower control bar you will find the menu item `next animal`. Use the `F3` key to execute this.

4. The window from step two will automatically open again and you can select the next animal.
