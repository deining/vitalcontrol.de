2. Either scan an animal using the transponder or select an animal from the list. Confirm with `OK` and select an animal with the arrow keys △ ▽. Confirm with `OK`.

3. A submenu with the animal actions opens. Use the arrow keys ◁ ▷ △ ▽ to select the action `edit` and confirm with `OK`.

4. Another submenu opens in which you can save various settings. Use the arrow keys △ ▽ to select the desired setting option. Use the arrow keys ◁ ▷ to select the desired setting.

5. Use the `F3` key to deregister the animal with the specified settings.
