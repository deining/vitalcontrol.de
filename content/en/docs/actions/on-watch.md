## On watch {#on-watch}

With the action `{{<T "OnWatch" >}}` you put animals on the on-watch list or remove them from it. The on-watch list helps you to find conspicuous animals more quickly and easily, making your daily routine checks easier. To apply the `{{<T "OnWatch" >}}` action, proceed as follows:

1. In the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item &nbsp;<img src="/icons/actions.svg" width="40" align="bottom" alt="Actions" /> `{{<T "Actions" >}}` and press the `{{<T "Ok" >}}` button.

2. Either scan an animal using the transponder or select an animal from the list. Confirm with `{{<T "Ok" >}}` and select an animal with the arrow keys △ ▽. Confirm with `{{<T "Ok" >}}`.

3. A submenu with the animal actions opens. Use the arrow keys ◁ ▷ △ ▽ to select the &nbsp;<img src="/icons/actions/on-watch.svg" width="35" align="bottom" alt="On watch" /> `{{<T "OnWatch" >}}` action and confirm with `{{<T "Ok" >}}`.

4. A notification appears that the animal was successfully added to the on-watch list.

5. You can remove the animal from the on-watch list again by applying the &nbsp;<img src="/icons/actions/on-watch-minus.svg" width="35" align="bottom" alt="Not on watch" />  `{{<T "OnWatch" >}}` action again. Whether you add or remove the animal from the on-watch list by using the `{{<T "OnWatch" >}}` action is indicated with a small ⊕ or ⊖ sign.
