## On watch

With the action `on watch` you put animals on the on-watch list or remove them from it. The on-watch list helps you to find conspicuous animals more quickly and easily, making your daily routine checks easier. To apply the `on watch` action, proceed as follows:

1. In the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item &nbsp;<img src="/icons/actions.svg" width="40" align="bottom" alt="Actions" /> `Actions` and press the `OK` button.

2. Either scan an animal using the transponder or select an animal from the list. Confirm with `OK` and select an animal with the arrow keys △ ▽. Confirm with `OK`.

3. A submenu with the animal actions opens. Use the arrow keys ◁ ▷ △ ▽ to select the &nbsp;<img src="/icons/on-watchplus.svg" width="40" align="bottom" alt="On watch" /> `on watch` action and confirm with `OK`.

4. A notification appears that the animal was successfully added to the on-watch list.

5. You can remove the animal from the on-watch list again by applying the &nbsp;<img src="/icons/on-watchminus.svg" width="40" align="bottom" alt="On watch" />  `on watch` action again. Whether you add or remove the animal from the on-watch list by using the `on watch` action is indicated with a small + or - sign.
