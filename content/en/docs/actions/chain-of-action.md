## Chain of action

The `Chain of action` function allows you to carry out an individually adjustable sequence of `Actions`. This function helps you to simplify and speed up the daily routine check in the barn. For example, you can set up an action chain with the actions `Temperature` and `Rating`. As soon as you call up the action chain, the two actions `Temperature` and `Rating` are carried out automatically one after the other.
