1. On the main screen of your VitalControl device, select the menu item `Actions` and press the `OK` button.

2. Use the `On/Off` button either directly or scan an animal beforehand.

3. A submenu opens. Use the arrow keys △ ▽ to select the menu item `menu items` and confirm with `OK`.

4. Another submenu opens with all the actions you can display. Select the desired action using the arrow keys △ ▽ and confirm with `OK`. The action will now be displayed or no longer displayed to you, depending on its initial status. A yellow circle marks actions that are shown, a gray circle marks actions that are not shown.

5. If you would like to `enable all + reset order`, select the corresponding menu item using the arrow keys and confirm with `OK`.

6. Save the settings and use the `F1` key to return to the `actions` menu.
