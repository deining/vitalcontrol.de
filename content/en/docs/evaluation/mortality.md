You can create a filter in each of the following evaluations. See for this [Filter](../create-filter/)
{{% /alert %}}

In this evaluation you can view your mortality as a history. The mortality is given to you as a percentage and divided into the categories green, yellow and red.

To perform the evaluation, proceed as follows:

1. Open the menu `Evaluation` in the main screen of your VitalControl device.

2. Another submenu opens in which you can choose between `Weight`, `Temperature`, `Rating` and `Mortality`. Select `Mortality` and confirm with `OK`. 

3. The device now starts to calculate the success variables.
