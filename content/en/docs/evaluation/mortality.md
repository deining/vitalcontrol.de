In this evaluation you can view your loss rates as a history. The loss rate is given to you as a percentage and divided into the categories green, yellow and red. The stored percentages are factory set, the green area is between INSERT NUMBER, the yellow area is between INSERT NUMBER, the red area is between INSERT NUMBER.
To perform the evaluation, proceed as follows:

1. Open the main screen of your VitalControl device and select the `Evaluate` menu. Confirm with `OK`.

2. Another submenu opens in which you can use the arrow keys △ ▽ ◁ ▷ to choose between the menu items `Weight`, `Temperature`, `Rating` and `Mortality`. Select `Mortality` and confirm with `OK`.

3. The device now starts to calculate the success variables.
