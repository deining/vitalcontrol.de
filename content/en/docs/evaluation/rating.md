## Evalute rating

In this evaluation you can see the following information as a clear pie chart:
- Evaluation of the condition of the last three days
- Evaluation of the condition overall

To perform the evaluation, proceed as follows:

1. Open the menu `Evaluation` in the main screen of your VitalControl device.

2. Another submenu opens in which you can choose between `Weight`, `Temperature`, `Rating` and `Mortality`. Select `Rating` and confirm with `OK`. 

3. The device now starts to calculate the success variables.
