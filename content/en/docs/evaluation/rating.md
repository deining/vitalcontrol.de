In the default setting, all animals stored on the VitalControl are included in the evaluation. By using a [filter](../../filter/) you can restrict the evaluation to a subset of the animals on your device, e.g. only to male animals or to animals up to a certain maximum age.

## Evaluate rating

In this evaluation you can see the following information as a pie chart:
- Evaluation of the condition of the last three days
- Evaluation of the overall condition

To perform the evaluation, proceed as follows:

1. In the main screen of your device highlight the icon &nbsp;<img src="/icons/main/evaluation.svg" width="50" align="bottom" alt="Evaluate" />&nbsp; `Evaluate`. Confirm with `OK`.

2. Another submenu opens in which you can use the arrow keys △ ▽ ◁ ▷ to choose between the menu items `Weight`, `Temperature`, `Rating` and `Mortality`. Select the icon <img src="/icons/evaluation/rating.svg" width="55" align="bottom" alt="Rating" />&nbsp; `Rating` and confirm with `OK`.

3. The device now starts to calculate the success variables.
