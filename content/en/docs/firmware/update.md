First, make sure that a [newer firmware version](../versions/) is available for your device and, if needed, update the firmware of your device according to the following instructions.

## Required accessory

To install the update on your device, you need a dual USB flash drive (2-in-1 USB stick) Type-C/USB 3.0 with a USB C connector and a USB A connector. Such a dual USB flash drive is delivered together with your device. You may also purchase such an USB flash drive from different vendors.

## Preparation: download latest firmware

1. Insert your USB flash drive into the USB connector of your computer. Then create a new directory named 'update' in the root directory of your flash drive.

1. Download the [firmware file](/download/firmware.vcu) (file name: `firmware.vcu`) and store it in the previously created directory `update` of your USB flash drive. The update file requires approx. 2.5 MB of storage space on the flash drive.

   The device performs the update automatically. During the update, the display informs you about the progress of the update. After the update is completed, the device restarts automatically and displays a success message after the restart:
